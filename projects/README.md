## Genius: a memory game 🧠 ([Click here](https://github.com/gabrielsanva/genius_memory_game))

Your challenge is to memorize the sequence in which the colors are lit and then repeat the same sequence (which gets longer with each round).

## TicTocToe (Jogo da Velha) 👵 ([Click here](https://github.com/gabrielsanva/jogo_da_velha))

I think the cool thing about this project is that the algorithm is generic enough to handle a board of any size. Feel free to use the create_board() function.

## Space Shooter 👽  ([Click here](https://github.com/gabrielsanva/dino-offline))

It is a simple game made with JS, CSS and HTML. Defend your planet and have fun.

## Dino-Offiline 🦖 ([Click here](https://github.com/gabrielsanva/dino-offline))

A small imitation of the Google Chrome game.
